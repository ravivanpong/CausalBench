# CausalBench
Causal discovery is a subfield of causal inference that aims to retrieve a causal graph from quantitative data. As in machine learning, there is no single algorithm that performs well in all scenarios. However, given the large number of available algorithms and ever increasing new ones being published quarterly, each claiming to be better than the state-of-the-art based on selected metrics, practitioners find the choices overwhelming. Since there is no ground truth for model selection and hyperparameter optimization, causal discovery algorithm selection is based on data assumptions, its sensitivity, if these assumptions are violated, and experience.
