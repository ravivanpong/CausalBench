Description
================
A network by medical experts for monitoring patients in intensive care. 
The data points are generated from the Bayesian network originally provided by 
I. Beinlich and G. Suermondt and R. Chavez and G. Cooper (https://www.bnlearn.com/documentation/man/alarm.html)

Each zip file contains in total 31 files, these are
10 datasets used for learning at each sample size (500, 1000, 5000) 
a file, [name]_graph.txt, containing the adjacency matrix of the true network. 

Larger networks are generated by tiling several copies of smaller Bayesian Networks until a desired number of variables is reached. 
The tiling is performed in a way that maintains the structural and probabilistic properties of the original network in the tiled network. 
The new Bayesian Networks contained 3, 5, and 10 copies of the originals and are indicated with the number of tiles next to the name of a network.

	abstract = {We present a new algorithm for Bayesian network structure learning, called Max-Min Hill-Climbing ({MMHC}). The algorithm combines ideas from local learning, constraint-based, and search-and-score techniques in a principled and effective way. It ﬁrst reconstructs the skeleton of a Bayesian network and then performs a Bayesian-scoring greedy hill-climbing search to orient the edges. In our extensive empirical evaluation {MMHC} outperforms on average and in terms of various metrics several prototypical and state-of-the-art algorithms, namely the {PC}, Sparse Candidate, Three Phase Dependency Analysis, Optimal Reinsertion, Greedy Equivalence Search, and Greedy Search. These are the ﬁrst empirical results simultaneously comparing most of the major Bayesian network algorithms against each other. {MMHC} offers certain theoretical advantages, speciﬁcally over the Sparse Candidate algorithm, corroborated by our experiments. {MMHC} and detailed results of our study are publicly available at http://www.dsl-lab.org/supplements/mmhc paper/mmhc index.html.},
