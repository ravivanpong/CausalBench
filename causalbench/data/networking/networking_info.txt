Description
================
Gentzel et al. (2019) identified a pool of websites using a small web crawl. 
several web requests were then executed against each site, varying request parameters. Outputs were monitored.


Files
================
networking_data.csv		data in comma (,) -separated format
networking_target.csv		edge list of the ground truth graph (no weights)	


Metadata
=================
2,599 subjects
3 treatments
5 outcomes
1 covariate
