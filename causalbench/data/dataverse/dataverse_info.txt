Graph datasets in csv format.
Used in the article Learning Functional Causal Models with Generative Neural Networks. Olivier Goudet - Diviyan Kalainathan - Aris Tritas - Philippe Caillou - Paola Tubaro - Isabelle Guyon - Michèle Sébag

Each file *_numdata.csv contain the data of around 20 variables connected in a graph.
There are 3 hidden variables.
Each file *_skeleton.csv contains the skeleton of the graph (including spurious links due to common hidden cause)
Each file *_target.csv contains the ground truth of the graph with the direct visible cause -> effect

The task is to recover the direct visible links cause->effect while removing the spurious links of the skeleton
