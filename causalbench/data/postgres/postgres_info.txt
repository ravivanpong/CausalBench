Description
================
Gentzel et al. (2019) collected a sample of StackOverflow‘s database, and gathered a sample of user-authored queries from their query explorer. 
Each query was executed against the sample of the database, varying database configuration and monitoring query execution.


Files
================
postgressql_data.csv		data in comma (,) -separated format
postgressql_target.csv		edge list of the ground truth graph (no weights)	


Metadata
=================
11,252 subjects
3 treatments
7 outcomes
10 covariates


Variable description
====================
Field Name 				Category 			Description
url 					subject identifier 	Identifies the source of the query
trial 					trial identifier 	
index_level 			treatment 			Indicates the level of indexing employed.
												0: No indexing
												1: Indexing on primary keys and foreign keys only
												2: Indexing on primary keys, foreign keys, and other commonly-referenced fields
page_cost 				treatment 			Indicates the estimated disk access cost provided to the Postgres query planner. 0 corresponds the smallest disk access cost, 3 corresponds the largest disk access cost.
memory_level 			treatment 			The amount of working memory provided to Postgres, in increasing increments from 0 to 2
local_written_blocks 	outcome 			The number of blocks written to temporary tables andindices
temp_written_blocks 	outcome 			The number of blocks written to short-term working memory
shared_hit_blocks 		outcome 			Number of regular table blocks hit in the cache
temp_read_blocks 		outcome 			Number of blocks read from temporary tables and indices
local_read_blocks 		outcome 			Number of blocks read from temporary tables and indices
runtime 				outcome 			Runtime of the query in milliseconds
shared_read_blocks 		outcome 			Number of blocks read from regular tables and indices
rows 					covariate 			The number of rows produced by the query
creation_year 			covariate 			Year the query was created on the StackOverflow site.
num_ref_tables 			covariate 			Number of tables referenced by the query
num_joins 				covariate 			Number of joins employed by the query
num_group_by 			covariate 			Number of “group by” clauses employed by the query
queries_by_user 		covariate 			The number of other queries written by the author of this query
length_chars 			covariate 			Length of the query in characters
total_ref_rows 			covariate 			Total number of rows of all tables referenced in the query
local_hit_blocks 		covariate 			Number of temporary table and temporary index blocks hit in the cache
