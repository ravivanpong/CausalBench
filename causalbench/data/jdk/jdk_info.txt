Description
================
A sample of Maven-enabled Java projects from GitHub. 
The projects were compiled and the unit tests were carried out on each project, varying JDK options. The runtime behavior was monitored.

Files
================
jdk_data.csv		data in comma (,) -separated format
jdk_target.csv		edge list of the ground truth graph (no weights)	


Metadata
=================
473 subjects
3 treatments
5 outcomes
5 covariates


Variable description
====================
Field Name 				Category 			Description
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
repo_name 				subject identifier 	Name of the GitHub repository containing the experimentation code
trial 					trial identifier 	
debug 					treatment 			Indicates whether debug symbols were requested during compilation
obfuscate 				treatment 			Indicates whether a code obfuscator was run on the final JAR file
parallelgc 				treatment 			Indicates whether a parallel garbage collection was employed during execution (instead of serial garbage collection)
num_bytecode_ops 		outcome 			Number of bytecode instructions in the compiled code
total_unit_test_time 	outcome 			Number of seconds required to execute unit tests
allocated_bytes 		outcome 			Number of bytes allocated during execution of unit tests
jar_file_size_bytes 	outcome 			Size of JAR file after compilation (and possibly obfuscation)
compile_time_ms 		outcome 			Number of milliseconds to compile the source
source_ncss 			covariate 			Number of non-comment source statements in the source code
test_classes 			covariate 			Number of Java classes in the unit test source
test_functions 			covariate 			Number of functions in the unit test source
test_ncss 				covariate 			Number of non-comment source statements in the test source
test_javadocs 			covariate 			Number of JavaDoc comments in the test source
